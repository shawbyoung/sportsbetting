HEDGING 
*= extra 
*Perform analysis to predict a winner. 
Develop formula to optimize hedge 
Use formula to determine optimal hedge 
Use TheOdds API to find arbitrage. 
*Incorporate analysis into hedging protocol
Execute.

NAIVE
Using odds given by API. 

ELO 
Consider developing an algorithm for elo.
Incorporate into betting algorithm.

TRACKING
Consider tracking individual players/teams, trends in 
the playing could indicate future gameplay.

SPORTS BETTING ARBITRAGE 
Compare odds from different sources - find market arbitrage.

DATA SCIENCE APPROACH AND TIMELINE
    1)  Ideate -> (1-2 weeks)
        Find alpha, trad + nontraditional data factors that contribute to dubs

    2)  Main Research -> (2-6 weeks)
        a)  Logistic regression -> determine dub threshold. Also consider other
            kinds of classification models e.g. XGBoost. Consider multivariate
            models. Caveat -> must have some fundamental analysis. Lots of
            considerations to be had given added (exponential) complexity.
            Consider r^2, f1 score, among other stat metrics, review
            research stat, design research scientifically.
        
        b)  Develop hedging strategy -> Research. Research. Reach out to Joey &
            Victoria.

    4)  Historical back testing -> (2-4 weeks)
        Simulate trades, calculate earnings, consider broker costs.
        Adjust model.

    5)  Test trades -> (3-4 weeks)
        Develop a plan for sample trades - keep to this. Good sample
        size, don't get cold feet. Calculate expected earnings. Execute.
        Calculate earnings, compare to projected earnings.

    6)  Restructuring -> (2-3 weeks)
        Implement e2e ML, model testing, automate backtesting.
